Project Overview:
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds using different regression algorithms. We use a dataset that contains 10 features, including characteristics of the diamond like its weight, quality, color, and dimensions. Our goal is to build models that can accurately predict a diamond's price based on these features.

Dataset Information:

The dataset includes the following features:

Carat: Weight of the diamond.
Cut: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
Color: Color grade of the diamond (J is the worst, D is the best).
Clarity: Clarity grade, measuring transparency (I1 is the worst, IF is the best).
Table: Width of the top of the diamond.
Price: Price of the diamond in US dollars (this is what we want to predict).
X: Length of the diamond in millimeters.
Y: Width of the diamond in millimeters.
Z: Depth of the diamond in millimeters.
Depth: Total depth percentage of the diamond.

Project Steps:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand the relationships between features and the price.
Feature Engineering: Create or modify features to improve the model's performance.
Model Building: Use various regression algorithms (like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) to predict the price.
Model Evaluation: Check how well the models perform using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
Visualization: Create graphs and charts to show the results and insights.
